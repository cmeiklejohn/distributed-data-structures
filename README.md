# Distributed Data Structures

## Overview

An attempt at modeling various Lattices and CRDTs in Coq and Haskell.

## Files

* ```JoinSemiLattice.v```: An experiment in modeling JoinSemiLattices
  over naturals as outlined by Conway.
* ```Counters.v```: Work in modeling CvRDTs, specifically G-Counters and
  PN-Counters as outlined by Shapiro.

## Outstanding issues

* The current record definiton for CvRDTs does not support multiple
  update functions.  This needs to somehow be adapted for allowing
  multiple update functions to exist for a given CvRDT.  Not sure how to
  do this.
* How do we use these records for defining and overall signature for
  CvRDTS?
