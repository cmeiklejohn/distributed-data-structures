# Distributed Data Structures

## Overview

An attempt at modeling various Lattices and CRDTs in Coq and Haskell.

## Files

* ```JoinSemiLattice.v```: An experiment in modeling JoinSemiLattices
  over naturals as outlined by Conway.
* ```Counters.v```: Work in modeling CvRDTs, specifically G-Counters and
  PN-Counters as outlined by Shapiro.

## Outstanding issues

* Clock_true and Clock_compare need to return None, instead of Some true
  for the function to operate correctly over empty sets.
* Proofs for the update monotonically advancing for G-Counters is
  incomplete (and therefore incomplete for PN-Countes as they build upon
  G-Counters).  I discovered that proving the update monotonically
  advances when x = y and x <> y is trivial, given that the set is
  non-empty, but the proof I was working on breaks down completely once
  you start working with empty sets.  I didn't get far enough to add a
  hypothesis on the cardinality of the set.
* The current record definiton for CvRDTs does not support multiple
  update functions.  This needs to somehow be adapted for allowing
  multiple update functions to exist for a given CvRDT.  Not sure how to
  do this.
* How do we use these records for defining and overall signature for
  CvRDTS?
